This is a short script to plot and compare different macroeceonomic and socioecnomic indicators about various countries, as found in World Bank
(link: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#)


To run it, download the files and the script (developing_countries_compare_pub.py), place them in your working folder and edit line 37 of the script to include the path of that working folder

Running the code will save plots of about 100 different variables that you can then inspect to compare the status of these countries

Enjoy!
